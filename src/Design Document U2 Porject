LinearEquation class
Instance variables:

Hold initial user coordinates:
private int x1
private int x2
private int y1
private int y2
Holds values that will be defined in the constructor:
	private double yIntercept
	private double slope
	private String stringSlope
	private double distance

Constructor:
public linearEquation(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
	Will set all the values of the instance variables
Will also call multiple methods to calculate the slope, y intercept, and distance of points

Methods:
	public string toString()
		Returns a string with all the relevant information:
			(x1, y1) (x2, y2)
			Slope
			Y intercept
			Linear equation
			Distance between the two points
	public double calcuateSlope()
Will calculate the slope:
Take the absolute value of y1 - y2 divided by the absolute value of x1 - x2

To keep the slope in fraction form don’t actually divide them but instead store as a variable with the two values separated by a “/”

Round to nearest hundredth

	public double calcuateYInterecept()
Will calculate the y intercept:
	Take the coordinates of x1,y1

	Calculate the y intercept by using y1 = m(x1) + b
In general this means that m * x1 then subtract that from y1(y1 - m(x1))

			Round to nearest hundredth

	public double calculateDistance()
Will calculate the distance between the two coordinates
	Similar to finding the hypotenuse of a triangle,
take the absolute value of x1-x2 and y1-y2, square both sides, add them together, then square root the answer. (sqrt((y1-y2)^2 + (x1-x2)^2))

Round to nearest hundredth

	public string returnCoordinate(double x)
Returns a string with the coordinate associated to the x value provided as it relates to the linear equation
Multiply x by the slope and then add the y intercept.

Return as a string in coordinate format (x3, y3)

Round to nearest hundredth


EquationRunner.java
